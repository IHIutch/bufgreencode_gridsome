This section describes the standards applicable to the development of frontages, which are the optional elements of a building or site that help provide a transition and interface between the public realm (street and sidewalk) and the private realm (yard or building). These standards work in combination with the standards for building types found in Section 3.2 and are applicable to all frontages in the neighborhood zones.\n2. Table 3B: Frontage Elements identifies the frontages allowed by building type, with cross-references for frontage definitions and standards that apply.\n3. Any frontage element, as described in Sections 3.3.2 to 3.3.9, that encroaches upon a public right- of-way requires an encroachment permit per Section 11.4.1.\n\n<TableResponsive>\n\n|           | Attached House | Carriage House | Civic Building | Commercial Block | Detached House | Flex Building | Loft Building | Shopfront | Shopfront House | Stacked Units | Tower   | Standards     |\n| --------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------- |\n| Arcade    |                |                | &#9679;        | &#9679;          |                |               |               |           |                 |               | &#9679; | Section 3.3.2 |\n| Awning    | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;          | &#9679;        | &#9679;       | &#9679;       | &#9679;   | &#9679;         | &#9679;       | &#9679; | Section 3.3.3 |\n| Balcony   | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;          | &#9679;        |               | &#9679;       |           | &#9679;         | &#9679;       | &#9679; | Section 3.3.4 |\n| Canopy    | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;          | &#9679;        | &#9679;       | &#9679;       | &#9679;   | &#9679;         | &#9679;       | &#9679; | Section 3.3.5 |\n| Forecourt |                |                | &#9679;        | &#9679;          |                | &#9679;       | &#9679;       | &#9679;   |                 | &#9679;       | &#9679; | Section 3.3.6 |\n| Plaza     |                |                | &#9681;        | &#9681;          |                | &#9681;       | &#9681;       |           |                 | &#9681;       | &#9681; | Section 3.3.7 |\n| Porch     | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;        |                  | &#9679;        |               |               |           |                 |               | &#9679; | Section 3.3.8 |\n| Stoop     | &#9679;        | &#9679;        | &#9679;        |                  | &#9679;        |               |               |           |                 | &#9679;       | &#9679; | Section 3.3.9 |\n\n</TableResponsive>\n\n## 3.3.2 Arcade\n\n<FigureImg caption=\"Arcade\">\n    <g-image src=\"~/assets/images/3-3/3-3-2.png\" alt=\"Arcade\" />\n</FigureImg>\n\n**Description**\n\nAn arcade is a passage located along the exterior walls of a building and covered by the building’s upper stories.\n\n**Dimensions**\n\n<TableSmall>\n\n|       |                                           |                                                          |\n| ----- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **A** | Recess from the building facade (min/max) | 12'/20'                                                  |\n| **B** | Interior vertical clearance (min)         | At least the depth of the arcade recess                  |\n| **C** | Column or pier spacing, on-center (min)   | At least half the width of the height of the first story |\n| **D** | Column or pier width (min/max)            | 1.5’/4’                                                  |\n\n</TableSmall>\n\n**Specific Standards**\n\n1.

A plaza of 2,000 square feet or more in area must be organized around one or more central markers, such as a fountain or sculpture, to establish orientation and identity.\n2. A plaza should be sized proportional to its anticipated public use; i.e., on a temperate, sunny day, it would typically be inhabited by at least one person per 300 square feet of publicly accessible surface area.\n3. Circulation within the plaza must follow the probable desire lines of its users, connecting pedestrians to rights-of-way on which the plaza abuts and major design features of the plaza, such as seating areas or open air cafes.\n4. No surface area of the plaza may be more than two feet above or below the adjacent sidewalk level, except to accommodate a grade change between destinations.\n5. A plaza must be surfaced with high quality, durable impervious or semi-pervious materials, such as concrete, brick, or stone pavers, covering at least 75% of the surface area. Any non-paved area of the plaza must be landscaped.\n6. No surface area of a plaza may be sloped, unless required for stormwater management or to\n   comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.\n7. One linear foot of seating must be provided for each linear foot of plaza perimeter. Six types of seating may be used to satisfy the seating\n   requirements: moveable seating, fixed individual seats, fixed benches, seat walls, planter ledges, and seating steps. Deterrents to seating, such as spikes, rails, or deliberately uncomfortable materials or shapes, placed on surfaces that would otherwise be suitable for seating, are prohibited.\n8. The siting of the plaza should not be such that the plaza faces primarily north, casting the plaza in shadow during much of the year.\n9. Spaces for retail and service uses, such as restaurants, coffee shops, or newsstands, are encouraged to open out onto the plaza or be located within the plaza.\n10. A plaza may not contain driveways, parking spaces, passenger drop-offs, garage entrances, loading berths, exhaust vents, mechanical equipment, or refuse and recycling storage.\n11. A plaza may be allowed only in the N-1D, N-1C, or N-1S zones, by the express permission of the City Planning Board during major site plan review, per Section 11.3.7.\n\n## 3.3.8 Porch\n\n<FigureImg caption=\"Porch\">\n    <g-image src=\"~/assets/images/3-3/3-3-8.png\" alt=\"Porch\" />\n</FigureImg>\n\n**Description**\n\nA porch is a raised, roofed platform attached to a building forming an articulated entryway and semi-private social space.\n\n**Dimensions**\n\n<TableSmall>\n\n|       |                                           |        |\n| ----- | ----------------------------------------- | ------ |\n| **A** | Width (min)                               | 10’    |\n| **B** | Projection from building facade (min/max) | 6’/12’ |\n| **C** | Interior vertical clearance (min)         | 8’     |\n| **D** | Railing height (max)                      | 4’     |\n\n</TableSmall>\n\n**Specific Standards**\n\n1.
