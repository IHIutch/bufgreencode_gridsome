Flickering or intense sources of light must be fully shielded.\n\n## 7.6.4 Hazardous Materials\n\nThe use, storage, handling, transport, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials, or materials that present potential fire and explosion hazards, must comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Radioactive and hazardous material waste must be transported, stored, and used in conformance with all federal, state, and local laws.\n\n## 7.6.5 Noise\n\nNo use may be conducted in a manner that generates a sound level that is in violation of Chapter 293, Noise, of the City Code.\n\n## 7.6.6 Odors\n\nNo use may emit odors of an intensity and character as to be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Odors lasting less than 15 minutes for every 24-hour period are exempt.\n\n## 7.6.7 Vibration\n\nNo use may produce continuous, frequent, or repetitive vibrations that exceed 0.002g peak at up to 50 cycles per second frequency off-site, measured by seismic or electronic vibration measuring equipment, such as an accelerometer. Vibrations from vehicles that leave the site, such as trucks, trains, airplanes, and helicopters, are exempt from this requirement. Vibrations lasting less than five minutes for every 24- hour period are exempt.\n","headings":[{"anchor":"#761-dust-and-air-pollution","value":"7.6.1 Dust and Air Pollution"},{"anchor":"#762-electromagnetic-interference","value":"7.6.2 Electromagnetic Interference"},{"anchor":"#763-glare-and-heat","value":"7.6.3 Glare and Heat"},{"anchor":"#764-hazardous-materials","value":"7.6.4 Hazardous Materials"},{"anchor":"#765-noise","value":"7.6.5 Noise"},{"anchor":"#766-odors","value":"7.6.6 Odors"},{"anchor":"#767-vibration","value":"7.6.7 Vibration"}],"article_number":7,"section_number":6}},"context":{}}
