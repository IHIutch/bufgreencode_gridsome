Zones are designated on the Zoning Map.\n","headings":[{"anchor":"#accessory-structure","value":"Accessory Structure"},{"anchor":"#accessory","value":"Accessory"},{"anchor":"#addition","value":"Addition"},{"anchor":"#activation","value":"Activation"},{"anchor":"#alcove","value":"Alcove"},{"anchor":"#alley","value":"Alley"},{"anchor":"#alteration","value":"Alteration"},{"anchor":"#ancillary","value":"Ancillary"},{"anchor":"#appeal","value":"Appeal"},{"anchor":"#applicant","value":"Applicant"},{"anchor":"#articulation","value":"Articulation"},{"anchor":"#avenue","value":"Avenue"},{"anchor":"#average-ground-level","value":"Average Ground Level"},{"anchor":"#backlight","value":"Backlight"},{"anchor":"#bay-window","value":"Bay Window"},{"anchor":"#belt-course","value":"Belt Course"},{"anchor":"#block","value":"Block"},{"anchor":"#block-face","value":"Block Face"},{"anchor":"#block-length","value":"Block Length"},{"anchor":"#block-perimeter","value":"Block Perimeter"},{"anchor":"#block-side","value":"Block Side"},{"anchor":"#blue-roof","value":"Blue Roof"},{"anchor":"#boulevard","value":"Boulevard"},{"anchor":"#buffer-yard","value":"Buffer Yard"},{"anchor":"#bug-rating","value":"BUG Rating"},{"anchor":"#building-type","value":"Building Type"},{"anchor":"#by-right","value":"By Right"},{"anchor":"#caliper","value":"Caliper"},{"anchor":"#centerline","value":"Centerline"},{"anchor":"#chamfered-corner","value":"Chamfered Corner"},{"anchor":"#change-of-use","value":"Change of Use"},{"anchor":"#co-location-wireless-communications","value":"Co-Location, Wireless Communications"},{"anchor":"#color-rendering-index-cri","value":"Color Rendering Index (CRI)"},{"anchor":"#common-wall","value":"Common Wall"},{"anchor":"#comprehensive-plan","value":"Comprehensive Plan"},{"anchor":"#contiguous","value":"Contiguous"},{"anchor":"#cornice","value":"Cornice"},{"anchor":"#critical-root-zone","value":"Critical Root Zone"},{"anchor":"#curb-level","value":"Curb Level"},{"anchor":"#curbline","value":"Curbline"},{"anchor":"#desire-line","value":"Desire Line"},{"anchor":"#diameter-at-breast-height-dbh","value":"Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)"},{"anchor":"#drive-aisle","value":"Drive Aisle"},{"anchor":"#driveway","value":"Driveway"},{"anchor":"#dwelling","value":"Dwelling"},{"anchor":"#dwelling-unit","value":"Dwelling Unit"},{"anchor":"#easement","value":"Easement"},{"anchor":"#eave","value":"Eave"},{"anchor":"#ecosystem-services","value":"Ecosystem Services"},{"anchor":"#electronic-nicotine-delivery-system","value":"Electronic Nicotine Delivery System"},{"anchor":"#encroachment","value":"Encroachment"},{"anchor":"#established-tree","value":"Established Tree"},{"anchor":"#expression-line","value":"Expression Line"},{"anchor":"#exterior-insulation-and-finish-system-eifs-a","value":"Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS).
