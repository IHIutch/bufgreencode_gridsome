For a vertical axis wind turbine, the hub height is the height of the equator plane.\n\n##### Wind Turbine Rated Power Output\n\nThe power output of a wind turbine at a constant hub height wind speed of 25 mph.\n\n##### Wind Turbine Rotor\n\nThe rotor converts the wind energy into a rotation and consists of multiple rotor blades attached to a hub.\n\n##### Wind Turbine Total System Height\n\nThe height above ground level of the fixed portion of the tower, plus the wind turbine and extending to the uppermost reach of the rotor.\n\n##### Window Sill\n\nThe horizontal member at the base of a window opening, particularly the ledge formed by such a member.\n\n##### Yard\n\nAn unoccupied area that is open and unobstructed from the ground, with the exception of permitted encroachments, on the same lot as a principal building.\n\n##### Yard, Corner Side\n\nThe area of the lot that extends from the front yard line to the rear lot line, between the corner side lot line and the corner side\nyard line.\n\n##### Yard, Front\n\nThe area of the lot that extends between interior side lot lines or between the corner side lot line and the interior side lot line, between the front lot line and the front yard line.\n\n##### Yard, Interior Side\n\nThe area of the lot that extends from the front yard line to the rear yard line, between the interior side lot line and the interior side yard line.\n\n##### Yard, Rear\n\nThe area of the lot that extends between interior side lot lines or between the corner side yard line and the interior side lot line, between the rear lot line and the rear yard line.\n\n##### Yard, Required\n\nThe area of a lot measured from an adjacent lot line, or the mean high water line in the case of a required waterfront yard, that must be maintained clear of permanent structures, with the exception of permitted yard encroachments.\n\n##### Yard, Waterfront\n\nThe area of a waterfront lot that extends from the mean high water line of the adjacent water body to the waterside facade of the principal building.\n\n##### Yard Line\n\nA line drawn parallel or radial to the lot line at a distance equal to the depth of the\nprincipal building facade which is oriented to that lot line.\n\n##### Zone\n\nA geographical area within which this Ordinance governs building form and land use. Zones are designated on the Zoning Map.\n","headings":[{"anchor":"#accessory-structure","value":"Accessory Structure"},{"anchor":"#accessory","value":"Accessory"},{"anchor":"#addition","value":"Addition"},{"anchor":"#activation","value":"Activation"},{"anchor":"#alcove","value":"Alcove"},{"anchor":"#alley","value":"Alley"},{"anchor":"#alteration","value":"Alteration"},{"anchor":"#ancillary","value":"Ancillary"},{"anchor":"#appeal","value":"Appeal"},{"anchor":"#applicant","value":"Applicant"},{"anchor":"#articulation","value":"Articulation"},{"anchor":"#avenue","value":"Avenue"},{"anchor":"#average-ground-level","value":"Average Ground Level"},{"anchor":"#backlight","value":"Backlight"},{"anchor":"#bay-window","value":"Bay Window"},{"anchor":"#belt-course","value":"Belt Course"},{"anchor":"#block","value":"Block"},{"anchor":"#block-face","value":"Block Face"},{"anchor":"#block-length","value":"Block Length"},{"anchor":"#block-perimeter","value":"Block Perimeter"},{"anchor":"#block-side","value":"Block Side"},{"anchor":"#blue-roof","value":"Blue Roof"},{"anchor":"#boulevard","value":"Boulevard"},{"anchor":"#buffer-yard","value":"Buffer Yard"},{"anchor":"#bug-rating","value":"BUG Rating"},{"anchor":"#building-type","value":"Building Type"},{"anchor":"#by-right","value":"By Right"},{"anchor":"#caliper","value":"Caliper"},{"anchor":"#centerline","value":"Centerline"},{"anchor":"#chamfered-corner","value":"Chamfered Corner"},{"anchor":"#change-of-use","value":"Change of Use"},{"anchor":"#co-location-wireless-communications","value":"Co-Location, Wireless Communications"},{"anchor":"#color-rendering-index-cri","value":"Color Rendering Index (CRI)"},{"anchor":"#common-wall","value":"Common Wall"},{"anchor":"#comprehensive-plan","value":"Comprehensive Plan"},{"anchor":"#contiguous","value":"Contiguous"},{"anchor":"#cornice","value":"Cornice"},{"anchor":"#critical-root-zone","value":"Critical Root Zone"},{"anchor":"#curb-level","value":"Curb Level"},{"anchor":"#curbline","value":"Curbline"},{"anchor":"#desire-line","value":"Desire Line"},{"anchor":"#diameter-at-breast-height-dbh","value":"Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)"},{"anchor":"#drive-aisle","value":"Drive Aisle"},{"anchor":"#driveway","value":"Driveway"},{"anchor":"#dwelling","value":"Dwelling"},{"anchor":"#dwelling-unit","value":"Dwelling Unit"},{"anchor":"#easement","value":"Easement"},{"anchor":"#eave","value":"Eave"},{"anchor":"#ecosystem-services","value":"Ecosystem Services"},{"anchor":"#electronic-nicotine-delivery-system","value":"Electronic Nicotine Delivery System"},{"anchor":"#encroachment","value":"Encroachment"},{"anchor":"#established-tree","value":"Established Tree"},{"anchor":"#expression-line","value":"Expression Line"},{"anchor":"#exterior-insulation-and-finish-system-eifs-a","value":"Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS).
