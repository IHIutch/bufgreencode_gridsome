For lots of one acre or more in area, a minimum of 10% of total contiguous area under single ownership or control must be devoted to accessible open space, such as squares, greens, or greenways, located at high-use portions of the site. This open space should be framed by building facades where possible and should compl with the standards of the D-OS and/or D-OG zone. In lieu of site-by-site compliance, propert owners of contiguous lots within the same zone may provide this accessible open space on an aggregate basis, so long as the total area of the space is equal to or greater tha the combined minimum required area of accessible open space for each individual lot and the spac is within 1,320 feet of sites served.\n2. The following exterior facade materials are restricted on principal buildings:\n\n   1. Exterior insulating finishing systems (EIFS) are prohibited on the ground story of front facades, only where the proposed project is adjacent to and on the same block face, or across a public right-of-way and within 150’, of a Neighborhood Zone.\n   2. Standard, fluted, or split face concrete masonry units (CMUs) are prohibited above the basement level on front and corner side facades, only where the proposed project is adjacent to and on the same block face, or across a public right-of-way and within 150’, of a Neighborhood Zone. Glazed or heavily polished CMUs are allowed.\n   3. Vinyl siding is prohibited.\n   4. Reflective wall surface material with a Visible Light Reflectance (VLR) of greater than 15% is prohibited.\n","headings":[{"anchor":"#441-purpose","value":"4.4.1 Purpose"},{"anchor":"#442-general","value":"4.4.2 General"},{"anchor":"#443-lot","value":"4.4.3 Lot"},{"anchor":"#444-siting","value":"4.4.4 Siting"},{"anchor":"#445-height","value":"4.4.5 Height"},{"anchor":"#446-activation","value":"4.4.6 Activation"},{"anchor":"#447-specific-standards","value":"4.4.7 Specific Standards"}],"article_number":4,"section_number":4}},"context":{}}
