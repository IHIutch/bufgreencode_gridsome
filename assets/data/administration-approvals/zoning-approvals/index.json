A zoning variance allows a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this Ordinance that create practical difficulties or particular hardships. There are two types of zoning variance:\n   1. Use Variance. A use variance is the authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the use of land for a purpose that is otherwise not allowed or is prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.\n   2. Area Variance. An area variance is the authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the use of land in a manner that is not allowed by the dimensional or physical requirements of the applicable zoning regulations.\n2. Initiation. The property owner, or person expressly authorized by the property owner in writing, may initiate a zoning variance.\n3. Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals must review and take action on zoning variances.\n4. Procedure\n   1. A zoning variance application must be filed, including payment of the applicable fee, with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the requirements of Section 11.2.1. Once it is determined that the application is complete, the Zoning Administrator must forward the application to the Zoning Board of Appeals.\n   2. Within 62 days of the determination of completeness, the Zoning Board of Appeals must hold a public hearing on the proposed zoning variance. Notice of the public hearing is required in accordance with Section 11.2.2.\n   3. Within 62 days of the closing of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals must approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application. This 62 day period may be extended only by mutual consent of the applicant and the Zoning Board of Appeals.\n5. Approval Standards\n   1. Use Variance\n      1. No use variance may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals without making written findings of fact showing that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused the applicant unnecessary hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant must demonstrate to the Zoning Board of Appeals that for each and every allowed use under the zoning regulations for the particular zone where the property is located:\n         1. The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence;\n         2. The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the zone or neighborhood;\n         3. The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and\n         4. The alleged hardship has not been self-created.\n      2. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, must grant the minimum variance deemed necessary and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proved by the applicant and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the public health, safety, and welfare.\n   2. Area Variance\n      1. In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals must make written findings of fact that take into account the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted as weighed against the detriment to the public health, safety, and welfare by the approval of the variance. In making this determination the Zoning Board of Appeals must also consider:\n         1. Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance.\n         2. Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance.\n         3. Whether the requested area variance is substantial.\n         4. Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or zone.\n         5. Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration must be relevant to the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals, but does not necessarily preclude the granting of the variance.\n      2. The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, must grant the minimum variance that it deems necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety, and welfare of the community.\n6. Conditions. In granting a zoning variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals may impose reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property.\n7. Rehearing. An aggrieved party may petition for a rehearing of a matter on which the Zoning Board of Appeals has already once made a decision. A motion for the Zoning Board of Appeals to hold a rehearing to review such an order, decision, or determination, not previously reheard, may be made by any member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Rehearings may only take place as follows:\n   1. A unanimous vote of all members of the Zoning Board of Appeals then present is required for such rehearing to occur.\n   2. A rehearing is subject to the same notice provisions as an original hearing.\n   3. Upon a rehearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse, modify, or annul its original order, decision, or determination only upon the unanimous vote of all members then present, provided the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that the rights vested in persons acting in good faith in reliance upon the reheard order, decision, or determination will not be prejudiced thereby.\n8. Expiration\n   1. The zoning variance expires within one year of the date of approval if a building permit application has not been submitted or a certificate of occupancy has not been issued and no request for a time extension is sought within the original period of validity.\n   2. The Zoning Board of Appeals may extend the time for expiration of an approved zoning variance for one year upon a showing of good cause by the applicant. A request for extension must be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator within the original period of validity.\n   3. Any use approved by a variance, that ceases operation for a continuous period of one year, will be considered abandoned and the variance will thereby expire.\n\n## 11.3.6 Minor Site Plan Review\n\n1.
